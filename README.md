# Dissertation repository

- **Ablation**: Contains the ablation study using GradientBoosterClassifier.
- **Baseline SVM**: Contains the code for the baseline SVM.
- **Linguistic features and models fine tuning**: Contains the code for the analysis of all linguistic features and the fine tuning of the models. Additionally, we present some experiments with simple machine learning algorithms and an ensemble of the different fine-tuned language models.
- **Data frame preparation**: Contains the feature engineering for preparing the data for the experiments.
- **data_test** and **data_train**: the test and training data with the additional features.
- **erroranalysis**: the file containing the misslabelled sentences used for the error analysis.
- **fine-tuned BERT-ita**: the BERT-ita model fine-tuned on our data.
